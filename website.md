# Project 2: Website
##  I have always loved webdesign and when I started my IB course in Programming I was amazed. A website to me was a fantastic way to spread creations accross the internet and I knew I always wanted my own. I'll admit, my first tries looked like they came out of the 2000s but I have been learning ever since. With some help I made this website you see today. I can't wait to explore new websites using PHP and EJS.
