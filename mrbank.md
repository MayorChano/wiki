# Project 1: [Mr. Bank](https://bot.mayorchano.me)

## Mr. Bank is a Discord Bot I started in 2018 as a project to learn Javascript. It simulates a economy where you can see how active members are in a Discord Server and manage the currency. It's been a pet project of mine for a while and has completely absorbed me into the coding world making code my passion. 3 months after the start and 1 month after release, it has 350 servers with 60,000 users
