# Project 5: DiscordLists
DiscordLists was one of my bigger projects when it comes to backend because I needed to run through multiple APIs and display the content easily. This helped my learn how to use a "cache" where I made an array that cleared every hour that I would store information in so that I wouldn't have to request the APIs as often. This is also my most favorite project so far.
