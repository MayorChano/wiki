# So you want to learn about MayorChano?

### I am a backend and frontend developer working mainly with Javascript HTML and PHP. I am currently learning python to expand my knowledge! I started coding in August 2018 when I used the discord.js library to make a Discord Bot I now call Mr. Bank. Coding is my passion and I hope to continue it throughout my life.

## Project 1: BankBot (Mr. Bank)[https://bot.mayorchano.me]
### Mr. Bank is a Discord Bot I started in 2018 as a project to learn Javascript. It simulates a economy where you can see how active members are in a Discord Server and manage the currency. It's been a pet project of mine for a while and has completely absorbed me into the coding world making code my passion. 3 months after the start and 1 month after release, it has 140 servers with 49,000 users
