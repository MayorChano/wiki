# So you want to learn about MayorChano?

### I am a backend and frontend developer working mainly with Javascript HTML and PHP. I am currently learning python to expand my knowledge! I started coding in August 2018 when I used the discord.js library to make a Discord Bot I now call Mr. Bank. Coding is my passion and I hope to continue it throughout my life.
