# So you want to learn about MayorChano?

### I am a backend and frontend developer working mainly with Javascript HTML and PHP. I am currently learning python to expand my knowledge! I started coding in August 2018 when I used the discord.js library to make a Discord Bot I now call Mr. Bank. Coding is my passion and I hope to continue it throughout my life.

## Project 1: BankBot [Mr. Bank](https://bot.mayorchano.me) [Learn More](/mrbank)

## Project 2: [Website](https://mayorchano.me)
### I have always loved webdesign and when I started my IB course in Programming I was amazed. A website to me was a fantastic way to spread creations accross the internet and I knew I always wanted my own. I'll admit, my first tries looked like they came out of the 2000s but I have been learning ever since. With some help I made this website you see today. I can't wait to explore new websites using PHP and EJS.

## Project 3: [Text-Talk](https://tt.mayorchano.me)
### Text-Talk has been one of my favorite projects of 2018 for many reasons. It is the culmination of all the knowledge I have gathered in the past year on JavaScript and therefore has made it my most efficent and fast Discord Bot. It is a communications bot, acting as a messaging app between "servers" letting everyone communicate and socialize. It has already gained over 40,000 users since its release 3 weeks ago!

## Project 4: [GuildClean](https://guildclean.glitch.me)
### GuildClean was an idea of mine to collaborate with some of the people I had met along my trip of coding. It is a smooth bot that creates, saves and backups guilds so that Discord users always feel safe. One problem of discord servers is that someone always comes along and bombs them so I decided to have a backup system connected to an online dashboard. It is also rapidly growing!

## Project 5: [DiscordLists](https://lists.mayorchano.me) (Current Project)
### DiscordLists was one of my bigger projects when it comes to backend because I needed to run through multiple APIs and display the content easily. This helped my learn how to use a "cache" where I made an array that cleared every hour that I would store information in so that I wouldn't have to request the APIs as often. This is also my most favorite project so far.
